Lists: Putting it Together

Great! Now that you know all about lists, let’s write some code.

There are many ways to create lists and they can change depending on what language you are programming in. Here’s an example of a list in JavaScript that contains three items:

```
myList = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear']


```
In JavaScript, lists are created by defining a name for the list (such as myList), then setting it equal to a set of brackets []. If there’s nothing in between the brackets, the list is empty. But myList has three items in between brackets [], each separated by a comma ,:

'apple'
'banana'
'pear'
You may have noticed that those were all strings. We can also put other

 in a list, including numbers and

 values. We can even put other lists in a list!

To select an item from the list, we use the following syntax:

```

// the following line will return 'apple'
myList[0]



```

Where myList is the name of the list we are selecting from and [0] is the first item in the list. As we may remember, the first item is at the 0th

index
. So this code would grab the

, 'apple'.

Let’s look at another example using the following list:
